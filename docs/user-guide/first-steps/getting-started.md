# Getting Started

## Prerequisites
This guide teaches you to use WebGear effectively. However, there are some things you should learn before using WebGear.

### Haskell
WebGear requires that you have a decent understanding of Haskell programming language. You must have a good grasp of
typeclasses, functors, and monads. You should also be familiar with some commonly used GHC extensions such as
`MultiParamTypeClasses`, `OverloadedStrings`, `TypeApplications` etc.

WebGear uses few other GHC extensions. This guide includes material to teach you those features.

### GHC Requirements
WebGear 1.1.0 supports GHC versions from `8.10` till `9.6`. While other versions are untested and unsupported, you can
try them on your own.

### Build Tools
WebGear will work with both [Cabal](https://cabal.readthedocs.io/) and [Stack](https://haskellstack.org/). This guide
assumes you already know how to use these tools.

## Getting help
If you run into issues, see the [troubleshooting](../reference/troubleshooting.md) section first. You can
report bugs and request features in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/haskell-webgear/webgear).
