# WebGear - Composable, type-safe APIs in Haskell
Webgear is a framework to build HTTP APIs in Haskell. WebGear helps to run these APIs as a web application,
automatically generate OpenAPI documentation, and extract other static information about the APIs in general.

WebGear is developer-friendly. While WebGear internally uses many advanced language extensions, considerable effort is
spent in exposing only a small portion of it in user APIs so that you need not be an expert to use them. It also has
comprehensive documentation and examples that shortens the learning curve.

WebGear is very flexible, allowing you to build your project the way you want. It is very easy to extend or completely
replace most of the components to make it work the way you need it to.

Learn more about WebGear and how it compares against alternatives in the [user guide](user-guide/first-steps/introduction.md).
